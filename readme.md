# Cube Scramble Generator

It is a python script to generate a random scramble for a cube of your desired length. This script uses the random python module to generate random choices from a list of possible cube movements during a scramble. There are various checks that take care of the edge cases where a prime move is generated just after a normal move of the same kind and for the case where a two mover is generated just after a one mover of a same kind.

### Use this script to generate random scrambles for your cube solving practice.
